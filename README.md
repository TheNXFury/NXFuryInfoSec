# Summary

The NXFury curriculum is a **complete education in information security** using online materials.
It's not merely for career training or professional development.
It's for those who want a proper, *well-rounded* grounding in concepts fundamental to all information security disciplines,
and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own,
but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

It is designed based on the Open Source Society's Computer Science curriculum,
and it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already vaguely familiar with the world of computing.
The courses themselves are hand selected for the highest quality, but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

**Courses must**:
- Be open for enrollment
- Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)
- Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles

When no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented with a book.
When a student wishes to pursue industry, level certifications, the curriculum shall
include opportunities to substitute training for those in place of pre-existing course materials.
When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md) or [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

**Organization**. The curriculum is designed as follows:
- *Intro CS*: for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them
- *Core CS*: corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take
- *Advanced CS*: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests
- *Final Project*: a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide

**Duration**. It is possible to finish within about 2 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 20 hours/week to your studies. Learners can use [this spread
](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bkUU90y4rKYQHwY5AR2iX6iiPTrPEsYs75GkCAkrgm4/copy) to estimate their end date. Make a copy and input your start date and expected hours per week in the `Timeline` sheet. As you work through courses you can enter your actual course completion dates in the `Curriculum Data` sheet and get updated completion estimates.

**Cost**. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded.
Note that both [Coursera](https://www.coursera.support/s/article/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship?language=en_US) and [edX](https://courses.edx.org/financial-assistance/) offer financial aid.

Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget;
just remember that you can't purchase success!

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups of up to 5, ideally following the suggested order.
- We recommend doing all courses in Core CS, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core CS) in order from top to bottom, as they have already been [topologically sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) by their prerequisites.
- Courses in Advanced CS are electives. Choose one subject (e.g. Advanced programming) you want to become an expert in and take all the courses under that heading. You can also create your own custom subject, but we recommend getting validation from the community on the subject you choose.

**Content policy**. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to.
*Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct* that you signed in the beginning of each course!

## Final project

The NXFury Information Security curriculum is project-focused.
The assignments and exams for each course are to prepare you to use your knowledge to solve real-world problems.

After you've gotten through the above curriculum, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
Not only does real project work look great on a resume, but the project will also validate and consolidate your knowledge.
You can create something entirely new, or you can find an existing project that needs help via websites like
[CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
or
[First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/).

### Evaluation

Upon completing your final project:
- Submit your project's information to [PROJECTS](PROJECTS.md) via a pull request.
- Put the NXFury Information Security badge in the README of your repository!
[![NXFury - Information Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/NXFURY-Information%20Security-blue.svg)](https://github.com/TheNXFury/NXFuryInfoSec)

  - Markdown: `[![NXFury- Information Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/NXFURY-Information%20Security-blue.svg)](https://github.com/TheNXFury/NXFuryInfoSec)`
  - HTML: `<a href="https://github.com/TheNXFury/NXFuryInfoSec"><img alt="NXFury- Information Security" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/NXFURY-Information%20Security-blue.svg"></a>`
- Use our [community](#community) channels to announce it to your fellow students.

Solicit feedback from your NXFury peers.
You will not be "graded" in the traditional sense — everyone has their own measurements for what they consider a success.
The purpose of the evaluation is to act as your first announcement to the world that you are an information security specialist
and to get experience listening to feedback — both positive and negative.

The final project evaluation has a second purpose: to evaluate whether NXFury,
through its community and curriculum, is successful in its mission to guide independent learners in obtaining a world-class information security education.

### Cooperative work

You can create this project alone or with other students!
**We love cooperative work**!
Use our [channels](#community) to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!

### Which programming languages should I use?

My friend, here is the best part of liberty!
You can use **any** language that you want to complete the final project.

The important thing is to **internalize** the core concepts and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

### How we grade your project

In our [Discord Server,](https://discord.gg/BEWfqfdffD) please submit your project as a github repo to our staff. Your project will be graded on the following:
- Demonstration of skills you have learned throughout the curriculum
- Project is of sufficient size for the quantity of people involved in the project

Students should note that the following will not be accepted as submissions:
- Projects involving any illegal activity whatsoever
- Attempts to "rank up" in penetration testing labs online.
- Projects that contain excessive copying of others' work.

## Congratulations

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Congratulations!

What is next for you? The possibilities are boundless and overlapping:

- Look for a job in information security!
- Check out the [readings](extras/readings.md) for classic books you can read that will sharpen your skills and expand your knowledge.
- Join a local hacker meetup (e.g. via [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)).
- Engage in bug bounties to make software more secure (e.g. via [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/)).

# Code of conduct
[NXFury Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/TheNXFury/code-of-conduct).

## How to show your progress

1. Create an account in [Trello](https://trello.com/).
1. Copy [this](https://trello.com/b/IScNSzsI/ossu-compsci) board to your personal account.
See how to copy a board [here](https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards).

Now that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass the cards to the `Doing` column or `Done` column as you progress in your study.

We also have **labels** to help you have more control through the process.
The meaning of each of these labels is:

- `Main Curriculum`: cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum.
- `Extra Resources`: cards with that label represent courses that were added by the student.
- `Doing`: cards with that label represent courses the student is currently doing.
- `Done`: cards with that label represent courses finished by the student.
Those cards should also have the link for at least one project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such a course.
- `Section`: cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum.
Those cards with the `Section` label are only to help the organization of the Done column.
You should put the *Course's cards* below its respective *Section's card*.

The intention of this board is to provide our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc.
You can change the status of your board to be *public* or *private*.
